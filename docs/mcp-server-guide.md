# Creating Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of creating MCP servers from scratch, based on the official VS Code documentation and best practices.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface. It follows a client-server architecture where:

- **MCP clients** (like VS Code) connect to MCP servers and request actions on behalf of the AI model
- **MCP servers** provide one or more tools that expose specific functionalities through a well-defined interface
- **The Protocol** defines the message format for communication between clients and servers, including tool discovery, invocation, and response handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Choose an SDK for your implementation:
   - TypeScript SDK
   - Python SDK (this repository)
   - Java SDK
   - Kotlin SDK
   - C# SDK

2. Transport Methods:
   VS Code supports two transport methods:
   - Local standard input/output (stdio)
   - Server-sent events (SSE)

### Basic Structure

MCP servers can provide three primitives:
1. Tools
2. Prompts
3. Resources

Currently, VS Code primarily supports the `tools` primitive in Copilot's agent mode.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose Your Transport Method**
   ```python
   # Example using stdio in Python
   import sys
   import json

   def handle_request(request):
       # Process the request
       pass

   def main():
       while True:
           line = sys.stdin.readline()
           if not line:
               break
           request = json.loads(line)
           response = handle_request(request)
           print(json.dumps(response))
           sys.stdout.flush()
   ```

2. **Define Your Tools**
   - Tools should have clear names and descriptions
   - Include all necessary parameters
   - Provide proper parameter descriptions
   - Support dynamic tool updates using `list changed` events

3. **Handle Workspace Context**
   - VS Code provides servers with current workspace folders using `roots`
   - Implement proper error handling and status reporting

## Configuration

### VS Code Integration

Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "your-server-name": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/your/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
   - Use input variables or environment files for credentials
   - Implement proper authentication handling

2. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Implement proper logging
   - Handle connection issues gracefully

3. **Performance**
   - Implement efficient request processing
   - Consider caching when appropriate
   - Handle concurrent requests properly

## Testing

1. Create test cases for:
   - Tool discovery
   - Tool invocation
   - Error scenarios
   - Edge cases

2. Use VS Code's built-in testing capabilities:
   - Run the `MCP: List Servers` command
   - Check server logs for debugging
   - Test tool invocations in agent mode

## Deployment

1. **Local Development**
   - Use stdio for easy debugging
   - Implement proper logging
   - Test with VS Code's agent mode

2. **Production**
   - Consider containerization
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Set up monitoring and logging

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Connection problems
2. Tool discovery issues
3. Parameter validation errors
4. Response formatting problems

## Resources

- Official MCP Specification
- VS Code MCP Documentation
- SDK Documentation
- Example Implementations

## Contributing

When contributing new MCP servers:
1. Follow the standard protocol
2. Provide clear documentation
3. Include example usage
4. Implement proper testing
5. Follow security best practices

Remember that MCP is an evolving standard, and staying up-to-date with the latest specifications and best practices is important for maintaining compatibility and security.
