# IMAP MCP Server Enhancement: Smart Email Analytics with Gemini

## Overview

This enhancement adds intelligent email analytics capabilities to the IMAP MCP server using Gemini's code execution features. The system will provide structured analysis of email patterns, smart categorization, and data-driven folder organization suggestions through the MCP protocol.

## Core Components

### 1. Smart Analytics Engine

- Pattern detection in email threads and conversations
- Intelligent categorization of emails
- Response time and priority analysis
- Automated importance scoring

### 2. Enhanced Data Extraction

- Smart content parsing with Gemini code execution
- Structured data extraction from emails
- Named entity recognition (people, organizations, dates)
- Topic and intent classification

### 3. Intelligent Organization System

- Smart folder suggestions based on content
- Priority inbox recommendations
- Follow-up detection and reminders
- Thread relationship mapping

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analytics Core

1. Create EmailAnalytics class with core functions:
   - Email metadata extraction
   - Thread analysis structure
   - Basic content categorization
2. Implement Gemini code execution wrapper:
   - Pattern analysis functions
   - Content classification
   - Entity extraction
3. Add smart folder management:
   - Folder suggestion engine
   - Priority scoring system
   - Auto-categorization rules

### Phase 2: Pattern Detection

1. Add conversation analysis:
   - Thread relationship mapping
   - Response pattern detection
   - Priority scoring algorithms
2. Implement intelligent filtering:
   - Smart filter generation
   - Content-based categorization
   - Follow-up detection
3. Add temporal analytics:
   - Response time analysis
   - Communication patterns
   - Activity tracking

### Phase 3: Organization & Automation

1. Build folder organization system:
   - Smart folder creation rules
   - Auto-categorization
   - Priority inbox management
2. Add automation features:
   - Follow-up suggestions
   - Response recommendations
   - Priority handling rules
3. Implement caching system:
   - Analysis result caching
   - Pattern memory
   - Performance optimization

## New Methods to Implement

### IMAPClient Class Additions

```python
def analyze_email_patterns(self, folder: str, days: int = 30) -> Dict:
    """Analyze email patterns in a folder over time"""

def generate_email_visualizations(self, folder: str, analysis_type: str) -> bytes:
    """Generate visualization for email patterns"""

def analyze_communication_network(self, folder: str) -> Dict:
    """Analyze communication patterns between senders/recipients"""

def suggest_smart_filters(self, folder: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Generate intelligent filter suggestions based on patterns"""
```

### New MCP Tools

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_email_analytics(folder: str, analysis_type: str) -> Dict:
    """Get statistical analysis of email patterns"""

@mcp.tool()
async def get_email_visualization(folder: str, chart_type: str) -> bytes:
    """Get visualization of email patterns"""

@mcp.tool()
async def get_smart_suggestions(folder: str) -> Dict:
    """Get AI-powered suggestions for email organization"""
```

## Technology Stack Extensions

- pandas: For data analysis and manipulation
- matplotlib: For visualization generation
- networkx: For relationship graph analysis
- scipy: For statistical analysis
- numpy: For numerical computations

## Expected Outputs

### Analytics Data

- Email volume patterns
- Response time statistics
- Communication network metrics
- Content categorization results

### Visualizations

- Time series charts of email activity
- Network graphs of communication patterns
- Heatmaps of email timing patterns
- Distribution plots of response times

### Recommendations

- Smart folder organization suggestions
- Filter creation recommendations
- Priority handling suggestions
- Automated categorization rules

## Success Metrics

1. Accuracy of pattern detection
2. Quality of visualizations
3. Usefulness of recommendations
4. System performance impact
5. User adoption of suggestions

## Implementation Notes

- All data processing will be done locally to maintain privacy
- Visualizations will be generated as both PNG and interactive HTML
- Analysis results will be cached to improve performance
- Modular design to allow easy addition of new analytics
